<!-- *** Description ***-->

    All Dominion Radio is a non-profit Christian radio station exclusively on the Internet to provide

    1. Commercial-free worship music to lift, encourage and edify the born-again believer into a deeper relationship with God through Our Lord and Savior Christ Jesus.

    2. Christian ministries, leaders, pastors, etc... that are called to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ a platform for their elect calling to reach the lost, the backslidden and to encourage the Christian soldier to stay on the battlefield.

    3. A platform for local and independent Christian artists to share their ministry of music.

    Christians in faraway contries, particularly missionaries, who don't have access to a terrestrial station, can list free to Christian worship music, and it doesn't cost them a penny. ADR picks up the tab for all programming, streaming and music fees. Fees are covered by leasing time slots to our minsitry partners.

    We recognized that this ministry is not by the hands of our founder nor anyone else but by the Lord.

    "This is the word of the Lord to Zeurbbabel: 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirt,' says the Lord of hosts."
        -Zechariah 4:6
